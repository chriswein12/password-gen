# Password Generator

## Description of the Website
This is a website that generates a random password between 8 and 128 characters, and includes the choice of using lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and/or special characters.

<br/>

## How it Works
* Simply click on the "Generate Password" button and follow the prompts to choose the number of characters, and what types of characters should be used.

<br/>

## Website Features
* Website has checks in place to make sure that if a character type is selected, the final password will have at least one character of that selected type randomly placed in the password.
* Checks are also in place to verify that only digits 8 through 128 can be entered in the first prompt to select the characters needed, as well as checks to make sure that at least one character type is chosen after.
